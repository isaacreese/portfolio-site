# Work

Eighteen years at a non-profit Constitutional law-firm has taught me the value of hustle. Working with limited budgets on tight deadlines has forced me to develop a swiss army knife of personal production skills. That constant focus on personal growth has given me the confidence to deliver compelling videos that could otherwise only be made with large crews, lengthy production schedules, and more funding.

In that environment I have developed a broad artistic range with expertise in animation, cinematography and editing. My video-production skills span the full production cycle including concept development, producing, scriptwriting, storyboarding, lighting, shooting, editing, motion graphics, audio mixing, and color grading. Below is a selection of my documentary work. I have primarily guided most aspects of these projects and I have included my roles for each production.
