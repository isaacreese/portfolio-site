# Work

Eighteen years at a non-profit Constitutional law-firm has taught me the value of hustle. Operating with limited to nonexistent production budgets and litigation driven deadlines I have learned to rely on a broad set of skills to deliver videos that punch above their weight.

In this environment I have developed a broad artistic range with expertise in animation, cinematography and editing. My video-production skills span the full production cycle including concept development, producing, scriptwriting, storyboarding, lighting, shooting, editing, motion graphics, audio mixing, and color grading. Below is a selection of my documentary work. Much of it I have production I have primarily guided, including my roles within each production.
